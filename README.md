========

`gin` is a simple command line utility for live-reloading Go web applications. Just run `gin` in your app directory and your web app will be served with `gin` as a proxy. `gin` will automatically recompile your code when it detects a change. Your app will be restarted the next time it receives an HTTP request.

`gin` adhears to the "silence is golden" principle, so it will only complain if there was a compiler error or if you succesfully compile after an error.
